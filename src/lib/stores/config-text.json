The index ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 indicating the lowest perceived level of corruption, thus representing the best possible outcome. The index is meant to reflect perceived corruption. It is explicitly not a direct measure of actual corruption, but rather represents the respondents' opinions on assumed corruption. These opinions may be based on personal experiences with corruption.",
